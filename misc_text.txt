**For Methods regarding coverage statistics**
Good’s coverage for all categories was calculated according to 

1 - singleton OTUs/total sequences

However, while Goods coverage provides information about the success of the sequencing effort in measuring the diversity of the system, it does not directly provide information about the success of the sequencing effort in recovering previously unobserved OTUs. To quantify the ability of sequencing to identifying novel OTUs or, in other words, to quantify the “distance” in the peak of the rarefaction curves to their hypothetical asymptote, we defined “OTU coverage” as 

1 - singleton OTUs/total OTUs

Whereas Good’s coverage estimates the probability that a new sequence will have already been seen, OTU coverage estimates the probability that a new OTU will match an existing one. It is therefore an extension of Good’s coverage in that it quantifies the probability that, for any given set of sequences clustered into an OTU, that OTU will have already been seen. Thus, high Good’s coverage means that any new sequence is unlikely to be novel, and high OTU coverage means that any new OTU is unlikely to be novel.

Text for the manuscript
Comparing the percentage of sequences with cultured representatives to the percentage of OTUs containing a sequence from a cultured representative revealed strong cultivation biases for several phyla associated with model/biomedically relevant organisms (Fig. X). The Tenericutes, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Spirochaeatae all had considerably higher percentages of sequences generated by cultivated representatives than would be expected based on the number of cultured organisms represented by OTUs. This likely reflects the extremely high number of cultivated  Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Escherichia coli, Bacillus, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, Borrelia, and others. Conversely, clades such as the Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Bacteroidetes had a lower percentage of sequences belonging to cultivated representatives than would be expected based on the percentage of OTUs that have sequences from cultured organisms, indicating that the cultivation efforts in these clades are relatively efficient with regards to available diversity. Regardless of these observations, the majority of OTUs from any phylum remain uncultivated, to say nothing of the diversity of organisms that may be encapuslated in the 97% sequence identity cutoff.
